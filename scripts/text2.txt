The special shell variable $IFS is used in bash for 
splitting a string into words. $IFS variable is 
called Internal Field Separator (IFS) that is used 
to assign the specific delimiter for dividing the 
string. Word boundaries are identified in bash 
by $IFS. White space is the default delimiter value 
for this variable. Any other value like ‘\t’, ‘\n’, 
‘-‘ etc. Can be used as the delimiter. After assigning 
the value into $IFS variable, the string value can 
be read by two options. These are ‘-r’ and ‘-a’. The 
option, ‘-r’ is used to read backslash(\) as a character 
rather than escape character and ‘-a’ option is 
used to store the split-ted words into an array variable. 
The string can be split-ted without using $IFS variable 
in bash. Different ways to split string data (with 
$IFS or without $IFS) are shown in the following 
examples. 9
